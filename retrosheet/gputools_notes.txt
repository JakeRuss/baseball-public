You'll need to install the CUDA Toolkit.

See:

http://www.r-tutor.com/gpu-computing/cuda-installation/cuda6.5-ubuntu

In particular, the following environmental variables should be set:

export CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda-6.5 
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${CUDA_HOME}/lib64 
 
PATH=${CUDA_HOME}/bin:${PATH} 
export PATH
