The NCAA list batters with at least 75 AB, which is ridiculous.
I'd set it at a minimum of 150.
Colorado State dropped the baseball program in the 1980s, but that's at altitude and will have a park factor higher than New Mexico.
Hagman was a 1B, Mags a 1B/3B, Robinson mostly 1B but some 2B.
Jeff Trout was a 2B, so that puts him in a class by himself.
